goyaml is a native YAML parser for Go, based on the LibYAML project. This is not a wrapper, this is a native Go library.

[LibYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) is a YAML parser written in C, created by Kirill Simonov.  Much of the difficult bits of the YAML parser are borrowed from his code, but the entire library is written in Go.

See the [Installation](Installation.md) page for instructions on downloading.

**Note:** New development on this library is being done [on BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/zombiezen/yaml).
